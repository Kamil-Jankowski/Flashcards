# Flashcards

**Stage 2: (ongoing)**

_**Description**<br>
We cannot play Flashcards with only one card, right? Let's make our program dynamic! Implement a custom card creation mechanism. Read a term and a definition from the console and create a card._

_After that, a user inputs a line as an **answer** (a definition of the card). Compare the user's answer to the correct definition and print the verdict._

_**How to submit?**<br>
This stage is auto-graded. The grader will input 3 lines (term, definition, answer) and check that your output contains a word:<br>_
* _wrong if the answer isn't equal to the definition,_
* _right if the answer is equal to the definition._

**Stage 1:**

_**Description**<br>
You may already know that a **flashcard** is a piece of paper that contains a **term** on one side and a related text you want to remember on another one. Flashcards are often used to learn a foreign language, so let's say this text is just a **definition** of the term._

_We offer you to create an application that emulates a set of flashcards on a screen. While developing this application, you not only learn programming, but also save paper!_

_As a start, implement a program that outputs a single term and its definition. You can print a term and a definition you like in this stage._

_**How to submit?**<br>
This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:<br>_
* _you output 4 lines,_
* _the first line is `Card:`,_
* _the third line is `Definition:`._
